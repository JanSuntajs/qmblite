"""
This subpackage contains tools for performing the statistical
and postprocessing analysis of the numerical resuts,

Modules:
--------

available_routines: lists all the postprocessing routines available.
                    TO DO: make this module private within
                    the subpackage.

data_extraction: implements a routine for extracting the data,
                 performing some kind of postprocessing analysis
                 and then storing the results to disk.

disorder: implements routines for performing the postprocessing
          analysis w.r.t. the distribution of the disorder samples.

entropy: implements routines for performing the postprocessing
         calculations on the entanglement entropy results.

rstat: implements routines for performing the postprocessing
       calculations on the r-statistic results.

utils: contains helper routines. TO DO: make this private
       within the subpackage.
